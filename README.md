cdlparser
=========

A python module for parsing files encoded in netCDF's Common Data form Language (CDL).

The current version only supports the CDL grammar recognised by version 3.x of the
netCDF library and tools (i.e. netCDF classic).

Please refer to the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/rockdoc/cdlparser/wiki)
for more information about using cdlparser, dependencies on other python packages, etc.
