cdlparser
=========

A python module for parsing files encoded in netCDF's Common Data form Language (CDL).

The current version only supports the CDL grammar recognised by version 3.x of the
netCDF library and tools (i.e. netCDF classic).

WARNING: This is currently a work-in-progress. It is not production-grade code.
